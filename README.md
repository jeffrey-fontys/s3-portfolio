## 1. Introduction

This document serves as the Reader's Guide for my semester 3 portfolio of the bachelor's program of IT from Fontys University of Applied Sciences. The portfolio contains the products I have developed during the semester and with which I prove that I have gained sufficient knowledge to fulfil the requirements set in the learning outcomes. This guide provides a brief summary of each product and section, and points the reader towards the files which contain the fully worked-out versions of the subject.

## 2. Research

### 2.1. Cultural differences

For the subject of cultural differences I have done some research about what culture is and what are well-known dimensions on cultural differences. I have also written about my personal experiences with cultural differences. This product helps prove my proficiency at learning outcome 5: Cultural differences and ethics.

## 3. CollectiCats

CollectiCats is my individual project and is a web based collecting/trading game where players can collect virtual cats and trade them with each other. These cats have unique properties as a result of their genes. Try to collect as many special and rare cats as you can!

### 3.1. Software design

For the CollectiCats application I have made a user stories, an entity relation model and a software architecture diagram. These diagrams/models and related information can be found in the software design document. [View file](/collecticats/software_design.md)

## 4. Eeventify

Eeventify is the name of the group project developed in collaboration with two teams from the Oulu University of Applied Sciences (OAMK) located in Oulu, Finland. It is an application that helps people find others who share similar interests to theirs and provides a platform to organize, discover and join events (online *and* in person) that correspond to their interests.

### 4.1. Software design

For the CollectiCats application I have made an entity relation model and a software architecture diagram. These diagrams/models and related information can be found in the software design document. [View file](/eeventify/software_design.md)
