## Ethics in software engineering

Ethics are a system of moral principles within a culture or professional field. They can be used to guide our decision making when we want to make honest, fair, respectful, and inclusive choices. In short, they can be used to determine what we feel is the *right* thing to do. In software engineering these apply to the design decisions that are made during the development of software systems.

The following is a list of several well known ethical aspects and best practices within the field of software development:

- Accessibility
- Respecting user privacy
- Ensuring security
- Informing users
- Deliver good quality (testing your software)
- Focus on your user's needs and/or desires
- Give users ownership of their data (preventing vendor/product lock-in)
- Make code public when possible
- Do not incorporate deceptive or addictive design patterns

### Why are ethics important in software engineering?

Ethics are important in software engineering because the software that an engineer writes has the potential to be used by large groups of people and might have a significant impact on their lives. As a software engineer you have to be aware and mindful of these possible consequences as you envision, develop and deploy your software. Not all consequences can be foreseen but you *should* feel responsible for attempting to ensure that your software does not cause harmful effects but instead benefits the people who use it.

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 

As a software engineer you need to be aware of the different ethical aspects, principles, and practices within the field. You should ensure that your software meets accessibility standards, that it respects a user's privacy, that it is secure, and all the other aspects as mentioned earlier in this document. In order to achieve this you have to critically evaluate your software design in all stages of its development, starting off with an ethically sound design and adjust it when necessary. Test and review your software frequently to see if it still meets your ethical requirements. Request user feedback and see if their needs are being met, and collaborate with them to improve your software.

### How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 

In order to make sure that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers like your colleagues, it is advisable to discuss these considerations when starting development of a new software project, as well as when welcoming a new member to the team. Good communication is key, ask your colleagues about their views on the subject and which ethical considerations they find important. It is also a good idea to monitor developments in the field by reading articles (on the internet) and attending conferences about software development.

Furthermore, it might be helpful to create a document containing ethical guidelines and principles for use within your team, or search for one on the internet and adapt it to suit your team and project. Make sure that it is accessible to each member of the team and that they know where to find it. Also plan regular reviews of it to make sure that it is still up to date and reflects the views and values of your team, amending it if needed.

//Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  
//Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts?
