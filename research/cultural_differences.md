As a software engineer it is likely that you will at one point in your career work together with people from many different cultures. This mixture of cultures often proves to be enriching and beneficial, but may also lead to misunderstandings, conflicts and reduced productivity if one is not sufficiently aware of potential cultural differences. It is therefore important to be aware of these differences so that these intercultural collaborations may proceed smoothly.

## What is culture?

Culture is a term for the collection of customs, social norms, ways of communicating, rules for behavior and beliefs of a particular society. It is a learned system largely dependent on the environment where a person is raised.

## Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences?

A Dutch social psychologist named Geert Hofstede developed a framework for cross-cultural communication in the early 70's called: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory. It consists of a number of dimensions along which cultural values could be analyzed. The theory has continued to be refined since and has grown from the original amount of four dimensions to six dimensions as of the time of writing. The dimensions are as follows:
- Power distance index (PDI)
- Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV)
- Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
- Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS)
- Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO)
- Indulgence vs. restraint (IND)

## Personal experiences with cultural differences

During the course of my life I have had several encounters with people from different countries and cultures. Some of these interactions have been in a personal setting while others involved collaboration in an educational setting. I will elaborate on two of these experiences below.

**Design project together with Russian students**  
I attended the bachelor's degree program of Industrial Design for one year at the Eindhoven University of Technology, and during one of the courses there I was assigned to a group together with three Russian international students. I remember them in general as being quite talkative, not particularly punctual and often working on several things at the same time. These characteristics would seem to align with the Multi-Active cultural cluster to which members of the Russian culture tend to belong, according to Richard Lewis. They also seemed to place importance on making sure that they fully understood what was expected from us for that particular assignment, asking for clarifications from the teachers and fellow students. This would be consistent with the relatively high level of uncertainty avoidance that can be found within Russian culture.

The cultural differences did not cause any issues for me in this case. I like collaborating with people that are talkative, as I am not particularly talkative myself and them being talkative helps to keep the group process moving along. Their lack of punctuality was also not a problem for me as I am quite flexible when it comes to schedules and working hours (within reason, of course). All things considered I look back on this experience as a positive and educational one.
