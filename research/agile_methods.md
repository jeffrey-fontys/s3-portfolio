## What is Agile?

Agile within the world of software development defines a set of frameworks and practices that attempt to improve the way software developers can work in an uncertain and turbulent environment. It is based on the Agile Manifesto which defines 12 principles that form the core values of Agile software development. It provides tools that allow developers to self-organize themselves in cross-functional teams.

Key agile concepts are:
- User Stories
- Daily Meetings
- Personas
- Team
- Incremental Development
- Iterative Development
- Milestone Retrospective

## SCRUM

Scrum is a popular Agile method and the one that I personally have the most experience with, as it is the recommended method within the course that I am following. It defines a specific flow of work whereby teams work in time-boxed iterations called *sprints*. These are generally periods of two weeks, sometimes three.
